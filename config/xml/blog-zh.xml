			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now, more than ever e-merchants must reassess and review their risk management and loss control procedures. With internet fraud on the rise again, according to Kroll’s Global Fraud Report – <a href="http://fraud.kroll.com/region-overview/canada/" target="_blank">‘69% of Canadian companies were affected at least by one fraud in 2012 / 2013&#8242;</a> &#8211; ecommerce businesses are particularly at risk.</p>
<p>Typically, credit card fraud can result in thousands of dollars in losses but, that’s not all. Fraud also puts your merchant account contract at risk and can damage your business’ reputation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17036" title="Desjardin Image" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/Desjardin-Image.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="260" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-16979"></span>As fraud attacks are rampant and causing huge losses to merchants, let’s review together how to spot potential fraud and what you can do to safeguard your business.</p>
<h2>Identifying fraudulent activities</h2>
<p>Most of the online sales are ‘Card Not Present’ transactions; this means that the e-merchant is confronted with a particularly difficult challenge when it comes to verifying and validating credit cards, as the card is not physically presented to the e-merchant for inspection.</p>
<p><strong>So, how can you spot ‘Card Not Present Fraud’?</strong><br />
Here are some of the characteristics or unusual purchasing patterns that you should be on the lookout for:</p>
<p><strong>1.Larger than usual purchases</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.Multiple purchases of the same expensive item</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.Buying the most expensive model</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.Many large purchases in rapid succession</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.Multiple cards used from a single IP address</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.Placing an order using a free email service</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.In addition, pay attention to special shipping requests:</strong></p>
<p>- ‘Express’ or ‘overnight’ delivery<br />
- Shipping to a single address but using multiple credit cards<br />
- Many purchases, using one card, and shipping to multiple addresses</p>
<h2>What measures can you take to prevent fraud?</h2>
<p>1. First and foremost, make sure that your <strong>online store is protected, to prevent potential attacks;</strong> that all account information is securely stored and that you work with PCI-compliant processors. Attacking computer systems and databases is the most common method for<strong> information theft.</strong></p>
<p>2. As a minimum requirement, online stores accepting credit cards should request customers to enter <strong>the security code, called the CVC or CSC or CVV2</strong> usually found at the back of the card. As this type of information is more difficult for cybercriminals to obtain.</p>
<p>3. Ask your Bank/Payment Processor to provide <strong>address verification services;</strong> checking whether the billing address and the delivery address match. Although, this is not always a sign of fraud, be wary if the addresses don’t match and the card holder requires express delivery.</p>
<p>4. Implement a <strong>3D secure protocol,</strong> which requires the customer to create a private code, when paying online. Again, this is something your Credit Card Processor can advise you on.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Compare the IP location with the billing address</strong> to make sure they’re in the same country.</p>
<p>6. For international customers, obtain an updated list of high-risk fraud countries; you can <strong>block the country IP or use geo-location technologies that can help you evaluate which transactions are valid and which are potentially fraudulent.</strong></p>
<p>7. Especially, for expensive items, use a carrier that requires <strong>ID and a POD</strong> (proof of delivery).</p>
<p>The above list is by no means exhaustive!</p>
<p>If you suspect that a transaction might be fraudulent, it seems obvious but, refrain from shipping your goods without further verification. Check that the billing and the ship-to address match and contact the card holder, if possible.</p>
<p>If necessary, escalate accordingly by following your Processor’ loss control procedure.</p>
<h3>Advanced fraud screening with Desjardins’ fraud prevention tools</h3>
<p>Desjardins is the largest financial cooperative in Canada. Desjardins and PrestaShop have teamed up and developed a module that comprises a full range of transactions: credit card payments, refund and cancellation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17031" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/Desjardinsbusiness1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="115" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The module includes advanced fraud protection tools, such as:</strong></p>
<p>- Security code / CVV2<br />
- 3D Secure: Verified by Visa and MasterCard Secure Code (optional)<br />
- Fraud prevention module.</p>
<p>The fraud prevention module helps you <strong>limit and block risky payments</strong> by applying specific filters that can be configured, according to business’ needs.</p>
<p>With Desjardins, you can benefit from highly competitive rates &#8211; exclusively for PrestaShop users:</p>
<p>- Monthly fee: $0<br />
- Fixed rate: 2.52%<br />
- Transaction fee: $0.25<br />
- Purchases deposited within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Desjardins offers robust and secure payment solutions designed to help you mitigate risk; and excellent, bilingual customer service.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/14656-desjardins.html" target="_blank">Desjardins’ module</a> is available native in the software or can be downloaded, for free, via <strong>PrestaShop’s Official Marketplace.</strong> It is compatible with PrestaShop v1.5.0.1 to v1.6.0.6.</p>

<span id="more-17000"></span></p>
<p>Although ecommerce here is still in the early stages, it is growing exponentially. This growth is partially due to <a href="http://postandparcel.info/59698/news/regulation/argentina-imposes-tight-restrictions-on-cross-border-e-commerce/" target="_blank">government regulations</a> on foreign ecommerce. Each citizen is only allowed 2 purchases a year from international online stores.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17002" title="Buenos Aires Argentina World Tour" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/Buenos-Aires-Argentina-World-Tour.jpg" alt="" width="522" height="291" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Restrictions like this help local online businesses grow faster. It has already helped put Argentina on the ecommerce map. Ecommerce sales for this country has exceeded $4 billion, making it one of the biggest in South America.</p>

This is why we created the smartest checklists to manage your online store. &#8230; <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/the-smartest-checklists-to-manage-your-online-store/" rel="nofollow" class="more-link">Read more<span class="meta-nav"></span></a>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We make lists for everything – from weekly lists for groceries to annual wish lists for birthdays. These checklists help us stay organized and leave nothing out. This is why we created the smartest checklists to manage your online store. We’ve compiled a list of tasks that are truly important for running an online business then divided them by how frequently they should be completed. These downloadable lists will help prioritize your daily activities to effectively run your online business.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16932" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/EN_-Ecommerce-Checklist.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="299" /></p>
<p><span id="more-16931"></span></p>
<p>These checklists are broken down by frequency – daily, weekly, and monthly. We then went a step further by organizing the lists by business function. They are listed in order of importance below:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">• <strong>Operations </strong>(keep your online store running)<br />
• <strong>Customer Service</strong> (addresses any problems / issues from customers)<br />
• <strong>User Experience</strong> (UX) (update your site to be more user friendly)<br />
• <strong>Collect Data</strong> (actively gather information)<br />
• <strong>Plan </strong>(schedule for upcoming events)<br />
• <strong>Analyze </strong>(draw conclusions from the data you&#8217;ve collected)</p>
<h4><span style="color: #dc143c">The PrestaShop Smart <strong>Daily </strong>Checklist:</span></h4>
<p>The daily checklist should be completed&#8230; well every day. They should also be completed in the order listed below. Although collecting data ranks lower in importance than operations and customer service, these tasks are relatively easy to complete. Get to them first thing in the morning, or you probably won’t get to them later.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re starting an online business, you’re probably reading this article as part of your initial research. (As a research addict, I commend you for that.) You have probably heard that you will need a good web hosting provider. But with so many hosting options available, how do you pick? We’re helping you choose an ecommerce web hosting provider by highlighting 5 important features.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16843" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/EN-InMotion-Hosting-Main.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="278" /></p>
<p><span id="more-16821"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #696969">1. Speed</span></h2>
<p>Speed, specifically fast load times, is very important. According to “How<a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/" target="_blank"> Loading Time</a> Affects Your Bottom Line” published by leading research companies, 47% of consumers expect a page to load in seconds. 40% of them will abandon the site if it takes too long to load. Once a customer gets to your site, it would be a shame for them to leave before they see your products. Your web hosting provider plays a key role in your site’s load speed. PrestaShop users are in luck! We’re partnered with <a href="https://secure1.inmotionhosting.com/cgi-bin/gby/clickthru.cgi?id=prestashop&amp;page=336" target="_blank">InMotion Hosting</a>, a world class provider of web hosting and our #1 recommended hosting partner. With MAX Speed Zones, InMotion Hosting delivers fast worldwide speeds for fast load times regardless of your location.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #696969">2. Customer Service</span></h2>
<p>As with most technology, things work until they don’t. You’ll want customer support that is available 24/7/365 with quick response times. Chat with the sales team or call support to experience the customer service firsthand. For an added bonus, check to see if they have forums. InMotion Hosting not only has a forum but specifically offers an Educational Channel for PrestaShop users. Also, look for companies with credible awards. Having an A+ rating from the BBB for 4 consecutive years speaks for InMotion Hosting’s dependable customer service.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16862" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/logo.png" alt="" width="137" height="83" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #696969">3. Storage</span></h2>
<p>Ecommerce storage is determined by the pictures and videos you use. Both their size and quantity quickly take up space. Some web hosting companies limit not only the amount of data stored but also the amount transferred onto their servers. Host servers like InMotion Hosting provide unlimited storage and data transfers which are essential when starting your online business. Your new ecommerce site should not be limited by data storage.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #696969">4. Domains</span></h2>
<p>The domain name is the web address that will access your site. Check out our recent blog post for tips on picking the <a title="How to Pick the Right Domain Name for your Online Store" href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-pick-the-right-domain-name-for-your-online-store/" target="_blank">right domain name</a>. Having a free domain is great but you’ll also want a few extra ones. These extra domains work as if you’re calling dibs on another web address, which is especially helpful when your web address is commonly misspelled. For example, someone who types www.prestashop.org will be automatically redirected to www.prestashop.com. With 6 parked domains included, InMotion Hosting helps ensure customers can easily find your site.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16841" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/www.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="120" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #696969">5. Security</span></h2>
<p>As an ecommerce site, you’ll receive payment for your products. A private SSL will help build customers’ confidence in your site. They protect not only credit card information but also user logins and passwords. These issues don’t normally arise with regular customers but are needed to discourage and prevent hackers from stealing confidential information.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16840" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/InMotion-Hosting-Logo.png" alt="" width="319" height="125" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">In addition to meeting and surpassing our top 5 features, InMotion Hosting also offers PrestaShop merchants:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">● 99.99% uptime<br />
● Automated backups<br />
● 300+ free applications<br />
● SPAM Safe E-mail Accounts<br />
● Money Back Guarantee</p>
<p>Start your online business today with InMotion Hosting’s fast hosting Speeds and the auto installation of PrestaShop at a <a href="https://secure1.inmotionhosting.com/cgi-bin/gby/clickthru.cgi?id=prestashop&amp;page=336" target="_blank">special discounted rate</a>!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a fact.  The online shopping scene is rapidly evolving: the number of online stores and buyers is rising; more sophisticated and powerful e-commerce tools are being developed; the advent of m-commerce &#8211; smartphones and tablets changing the way people shop; the increasing need to go wireless and allow customers to shop anywhere, anytime! <strong>You simply can’t afford to let your business lag behind.</strong></p>
<p>In our quest to improve our online offering, satisfy our customers and manage the complexity of it all, <strong>it’s key to select an optimal and simplified payment solution</strong> that will make it easy for your customers to purchase &#8211; by offering a wide array of payment options &#8211; on your online store and for you to manage the back-end.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16789" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/BluePay_Credit_Card1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="373" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-16783"></span></p>
<h2>Grow your business by accepting credit and debit cards</h2>
<p><strong>Recent statistics show an immediate increase in sales when businesses start accepting credit and debit cards.</strong>  Yet, the majority of small businesses do not offer these options and estimates indicate that <a href="http://www.prlog.org/12267117-consumers-spend-100-more-when-businesses-accept-credit-card-payments.html" target="_blank">up to 80% of sales are generally lost, as a result</a>.</p>
<p>Giving your customers the option to pay with their preferred payment method, not only will it drive sales but, at the same time, it will open up other sales channels, by allowing payments to be made by mobile phones and tablets.</p>
<h2>Save money on processing fees and consolidate your merchant services</h2>
<p>Most businesses will say that the high processing fees are the major stumbling block to offering card payments to their customers. It’s true that often processing fees are high. However, <strong>a careful pricing strategy can help you better offset the high card costs,</strong> for example, by:</p>
<p>- integrating the cost in your selling price; and<br />
- selecting a Card Processing Partner that has the ability to offer lower rates and the right price plan for your needs</p>
<p><strong>Another issue that often prevents a merchant from having a healthy profit margin and promoting growth is the use of different merchant accounts.</strong>  Working with multiple vendors adds complexity to your operations and it increases your costs, making payment processing very expensive indeed.  The key here is to optimize and simplify your operations by consolidating your merchant services into one main merchant account.</p>
<h3>BluePay’s services for PrestaShop merchants in Canada and USA</h3>
<p>BluePay’s specialized team of experts and specialists, combining over 100 years’ leadership, provide credit card processing services of the highest standard.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-16784 aligncenter" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/BLuePay_Logo.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="85" /><br />
Being able to leverage their long experience and expertise means that you will get <strong>the lowest processing rates,</strong> in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>With BluePay, you have access to a wide range of products:</strong></p>
<p>- All-in-One Merchant Account – save money by consolidating and improve your costs visibility and transparency<br />
- Credit Card and E-Check Processing<br />
- Mobile &amp; Tablet Credit Card POS Processing<br />
- Free Payment Gateway<br />
- Secured Hosted Payment Form<br />
- PCI Compliance<br />
- Security &amp; Support<br />
- Comprehensive Reporting</p>
<p>BluePay works with merchants all over the world and is <strong>a single source provider for all of your processing needs. </strong> <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/8966-bluepay.html" target="_blank">BluePay’s payment processing module</a> for PrestaShop is available for download on PrestaShop’s Official Marketplace – for free.  It’s also available native in the software and it is compatible with PrestaShop v1.4.0.1 to v1.6.0.6.</p>

Harry Fay is a UK based jewelry boutique – and PrestaShop merchant &#8230; <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/ecommerce-case-study-a-look-at-harry-fays-successful-mothers-day-social-media-campaign/" rel="nofollow" class="more-link">Read more<span class="meta-nav"></span></a>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16699">Mother’s Day is one of the most important ecommerce shopping dates. It’s a time when children worldwide purchase gifts to show their love and appreciation for their Mums. <a href="http://www.harryfay.co.uk/" target="_blank">Harry Fay</a> is a UK based jewelry boutique – and PrestaShop merchant – who wanted to capitalize on those Mother’s Day gift purchases.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16698" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/HarryFay-Logo.png" alt="" width="326" height="95" /></p>
<p>Harry Fay first considered a “Mother’s Day” Campaign with Google AdWords. They however, found the market to be oversaturated thus opting for a social media campaign instead. Their goal? Grow a substantial social media following to later convert into shoppers. Two weeks into their campaign they grew their social media base by 5400%. See how this PrestaShop merchant ran their successful social media campaign.</p>
<p><span id="more-16697"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16700" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/HarryFay-Main-1024x711.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="405" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #009999">The Challenge:</span></h4>
<p>Harry Fay is a family-run jewelry boutique that sells affordable silver jewelry crafted by masters. Jewelry made with the highest industry standards insures each gem-incrusted piece shines bright. After setting up their PrestaShop store, Harry Fay was ready to sell their pieces of art. They looked forward to ringing in sales with Mother’s Day, a major shopping holiday. Their initial plan was to target Mother’s Day shoppers with a Google AdWords Campaign. With CPC’s priced over £1, it was clear that this oversaturated market was not feasible.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009999">The Goal:</span></h4>
<p>With that setback, Harry Fay consulted a digital media agency for their social media campaign. Specifically, they wanted to use their dormant <a href="https://twitter.com/harryfaycouk" target="_blank">Harry Fay Twitter</a> account boasting 27 followers. They also chose to grow organically, opting out of sponsored Twitter Ads.<br />
Their Twitter campaign goals were to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">1) Increase Mother’s Day Sales<br />
2) Grow followers to gain visibility for future sales</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009999">Step 1: Organize a Giveaway</span></h4>
<p>Harry Fay understood that to be successful on Twitter, they needed good sharable content. They started with a “killer image” that delivered a clear and attractive message, “Enter our Giveaway.” Harry Fay asked giveaway participants to <strong>Follow </strong>@<a href="https://twitter.com/harryfaycouk" target="_blank">HarryFayCoUk </a>and <strong>RT </strong>(retweet) the image, ensuring this giveaway brings them closer to their goal.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16703" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/harryFay-twitter-main.PNG.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="378" /></p>
<p>This campaign increased their Twitter followers by <strong>5400%</strong>. After only 2 weeks, their Twitter following grew from a meager 27 followers to a staggering 1,500. Additionally, they maintained the number of followers after the giveaway concluded.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009999">Step 2: Convert Followers in to Shoppers</span></h4>
<p>Harry Fay now wanted to convert their followers into shoppers. Their first attempt was to offer voucher codes for 10% off all orders. This sale only generated fleeting interest but they did not let the conversions, or lack thereof, deter them. After the Mother’s Day giveaway ended, Harry Fay ran another campaign awarding all their Twitter followers with a £10 voucher. This campaign created buzz that brought many more visitors to their PrestaShop store. Although both campaigns helped to increase their sales, its success paled in comparison to their drastic increase in Twitter followers. As a result, Harry Fay did not meet their projected sales.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009999">Key Takeaways:</span></h4>
<p>Harry Fay successfully accomplished one of two goals. They significantly grew their Twitter following but was unable to convert many of them into customers. However by running this social media campaign, they gained valuable insight into managing their social media presence. Here’s what they learned:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>1) </strong>Although social media happens in real-time; building a social media presence should be a <strong>long-term strategy</strong>.<br />
<strong>2) </strong>Social media can be a rewarding a marketing tool. But to run successful Twitter campaigns, you must have good timing. The life of a<strong> Tweet is measured minutes</strong>. You must find the balance between Tweeting enough to reach your audience but not too often that it annoys them.<br />
<strong>3) </strong>Running Social Media Giveaways can be an effective way to gain new followers. However when you measure conversions, you must consider “<strong>compers</strong>” – followers only interested in the winning competition prizes. These followers are<strong> not interested in making purchases</strong> which decreases your conversion rate.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009999">The Success Story:</span></h4>
<p>The ultimate success of this campaign is the unparalleled visibility Harry Fay gained. With the large increase in followers, they&#8217;ve gained popularity not just among bloggers but interest from a major fashion publication. They set out to reach the short term goal of increasing Mother’s Day sales but instead begun to develop their long-term social media strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16699" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/HarryFay-Success-Feature.png" alt="" width="484" height="90" /></p>
<p>Congrats HarryFay, on your success and upcoming feature! Thank you for you for sharing your case study for this week’s success story. We wish you all the best!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many small businesses are still reluctant to accept credit and debit card payments on their online store, being somewhat intimidated by the process. And it is easy to understand why: getting a merchant account application processed and accepted can prove to be quite a daunting and lengthy task, and the possibility that your request will be declined is always a concern.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16683" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/card-acceptance-uk-online-stores-made-easy1.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="278" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-16559"></span>However, accepting and facilitating credit card payments on your online store is a must and a necessary step towards boosting your sales and increasing your customer-base. Now, let’s go over the different factors to take into consideration and introduce you to a simple way to accept debit and credit card payments for your online store.</p>
<h2>Why should your business accept credit card payments?</h2>
<p>Simply put, businesses that do not yet accept credit and/or debit cards are missing out on increasing their online sales and profit.</p>
<p>Studies show that the majority of <strong>customers prefer to pay by credit and debit card</strong> and will be more likely to make a purchase or increase their average spending, when given the convenience of purchasing by card.</p>
<p>In addition, accepting credit cards will <strong>encourage impulse shopping.</strong> Do you offer discounts and/or promotions? Make it simple for your customers to take advantage of your store’s special offers.</p>
<p>In the UK, about <strong>“91% of the adult population have a debit card and 61% a credit card”.</strong> With online spending using debit cards reaching £35 billion compared to £34 billion on credit cards, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-23149647" target="_blank">according to the UK Cards Association.</a></p>
<p><strong>In summary, these are some of the major benefits of accepting card payments:</strong><br />
- Boost sales<br />
- Attract more customers that prefer to use this payment option<br />
- Increase customers’ spending and impulse shopping<br />
- Improve your cash flow</p>
<h3>How to get started</h3>
<p>To start accepting credit and debit cards, you will need to set up:<br />
- A Merchant Account<br />
- A Payment Gateway, linking your online store to your Merchant Account</p>
<p>Some business information, to enable the Payment Processor to assess your application, should be provided: the type of business you&#8217;re in, sales revenue, number of transactions</p>
<h3>The best solution available to UK Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses</h3>
<p>PaymentSense has quickly become the card processing partner of choice for many small- and medium-sized businesses, thanks to their:</p>
<p>- Swift Merchant Account approval process &#8211; meaning your online store could be accepting card payments within 24 hours, following approval<br />

- Dedicated customer service<br />
- No long-term agreement requirements</p>
